Random Forest Model for Creditworthiness Prediction
This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer creditworthiness based on demographic and financial information.

Dataset
Source: Local CSV file (credit2.csv)
The dataset includes features such as customer demographics, banking behavior, and credit history.
Basic EDA and preprocessing steps (like encoding categorical variables) were performed to prepare the data.

Model
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

Additional Insights: Feature importance analysis to identify the most influential variables.

Results
Model Accuracy: ~77% (replace with actual value)

Most Important Features: amount, duration, tenure, purpose, value_saving_stocks (example â€” replace with actual)

Notebook
The complete code and step-by-step explanations are available in (Random_Forest_CreditRisk_Model.ipynb)
